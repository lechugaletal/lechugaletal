hello!

Most of the projects around my Github are Private, they basically help me in the process of deploying and maintaning my site and on-prem infra for other projects.
Anyway, if you find something around that helps you, feel free to use it and imporve/expand it of course (don't forget to tell me about the bits and nuances after).

I'm currently working as Cloud Engineer, with a strong focus on monitoring critical infrastructure, so any topic related is welcome.

Other non-thech-related-interests are:

- Music: creating and having great fun with people thorugh music its always welcomed.
- Deutsch: or in general language learning. Schick mir eine E-Mail auf Deutsch, damit wir uns kurz unterhalten können, deshalb übe ich


I tend not to be in social media, cause in the end I dont feel it appealing at all. But here are some other places you can find my work on the internet:
